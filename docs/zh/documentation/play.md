## Start the Game

Enter the following command in the console:
``` bash
legent play --env_path "<path to game executable file>"
```

The path for Windows is like `...\\legent-windows\\LEGENT.exe`, for Linux is like `.../legent-linux-[desktop/server]/LEGENT.x86_64`.

This command will start the game server and client. By default, you will see a randomly generated 3D environment where you and an AI are randomly positioned with first person views.

This command is equivalent to starting the server by `legent serve` and then running the game client executable file.
